as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token num discount on our bill

management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners

many people talk about the great pizza and poor service so it cant just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers

my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water she had a sore throat and i guess that since it was only water it wasnt a priority for them to actually bring it
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#394
in other words if they arent making off of you then you dont rate high on their service scale

any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table

when we finally were able to flag someone down it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food who was also not the same person who had taken our order

#414
after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant

a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointmentto say we had been blown off would be an understatement
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#416
the manager continually interrupted with is there anything else i can do for you a strange comment because she had hardly listened let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage but we could hardly take her promise seriously seeing as she hadnt bothered to get the waitresses name
