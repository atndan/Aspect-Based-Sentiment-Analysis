First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.

Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier" No apology, nothing.
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!

#1611
No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1613
Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1614
The level of rudeness was preposterous.
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1615
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.

If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.

The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.

The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!

Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.

Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off –

#1638
It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. 
{RESTAURANT#PRICES, negative}

#1639
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 
{SERVICE#GENERAL, conflict}, {FOOD#QUALITY, positive}

#1640
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!
{RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS, negative}, {SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1641
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1642
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF??
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1643
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1644
There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. 
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1645
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1646
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1647
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service.

While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.

This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1653
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1654
A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else.

If you go here, do it on his off-night.

Taking Hot Dogs to the next level

At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.

When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.

Never got an explanation as to what was going on.

The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.

When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.

On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.

Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.

I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party."

The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.

We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.

I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.

The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.

#1704
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1705
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1706
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.
{SERVICE#GENERAL, negative}

#1707
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.

I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.
